# Ensemble Learning with Computer Vision and Natural Langauge Processing for Multi-Class Prediction of Retail Products

This project uses both image data and text descriptions of retail products to classify them among 21 different retail types. The image data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/retail-products-classification/data). Both classical machine learning and deep learning were applied. Model performance was evaluated by mean F1 score. The F1 score was 0.76 on when performed on an unlabeled test set.
